A personal                         brand goes far beyond having a nice-looking business card. A personal brand is                         not just about having a website with your name on it, although that‘s certainly                         part of it.                      ●  Your personal brand is how you present yourself, both online and offline, to your                         ideal audience. Your personal brand is the image you put forth. It‘s what you                         stand for. Your values. What you‘re all about. The core of who you are as a                         person. It‘s the combination of your values, unique skills, experiences, stories,                         personality, and image, all presented authentically to your audience.                      ●  Every person is now a brand. Everyone can constantly put themselves out in                         front of their audience. Everyone can add value to their audience. Everyone can                         communicate their message loud and clear. With everything you share with your                         audience, you‘re building your brand.                      ●  The question is whether you‘re actively taking control of your brand. Do you want                         your brand to develop on its own, with no guidance from you, or do you want to                         be actively in control of the process? It‘s always best to be the one in control of                         your personal brand. I have a saying that “I AM MY BRAND”                                                                How To Build Your Personal Brand – Executive Summary  •2","Chapter 2:Why You Need to Build a Personal                    Brand                         ●  Every entrepreneur, coach, consultant, freelancer, etc. should be building their                         own brand. If you are trying to build a business of any sort, it‘s important to build                          your own personal brand.                      ●  Personal branding allows you to stand out from the competition. Your                         competitors can‘t bring what you bring to the table. They simply don‘t have what                         you have to offer. You‘re unique. Only you are you.                            You have unique experiences, strengths, beliefs, perspectives, skills, and                        insights that set you apart from everyone else. Building your personal brand                          allows you highlight your strengths.                      ●  Personal branding allows you to charge a premium price. Because you bring                          unique value to the table - value that no one else offers - you can charge a                        premium price for your services.                           When you craft a strong personal brand, you can charge a higher price for your                          products and services because they‘re exclusive to you.                      ●  Personal branding highlights your expertise. A significant amount of personal                          branding involves the content that you share with the world. The more valuable                        the content you share, the more you demonstrate that you‘re an expert who                          should be trusted.                                                           How To Build Your Personal Brand – Executive Summary  •3","With every piece of content that you share, you establish yourself as an expert in                         your field. The more you show that you‘re an expert, the more people will trust                         you.                      ●  Personal branding allows you to attract your ideal audience. When you‘re an                         expert, you attract those who need your help the most. They want help from you                         because you‘re the expert. It also generates more referrals from others in your                         field. And it allows you to charge a premium price.                       ●  Personal branding puts you in charge of the narrative. Your personal brand will                         evolve, whether you want it to or not. If you use social media, have an email list,                         write a blog, or speak to groups, you‘re already building your personal brand. The                         question is whether you‘re building the brand intentionally.                           Personal brand building ensures that you‘re the one forming people‘s ideas and                         opinions about you. You‘re in control of the story.                      ●  Personal branding increases your visibility. As you build your personal brand,                         you‘ll become more visible. You‘ll attract more fans on social media, who will                         share your content with their tribes, which will then attract more fans.                           You‘ll also be featured in more media outlets since they‘re always looking for                         experts. And you‘ll be invited to speak at more places. As you build your brand,                         your platform will also grow.                                                                  How To Build Your Personal Brand – Executive Summary  •4","●  Personal branding shapes the content you share. Without a personal brand, you                         have nothing guiding you in terms of what content you should be sharing with                         your audience.                           Personal branding gives you guidelines as to what you should share with your                         audience. You should only share things that are in line with your brand. Anything                         off-brand shouldn’t be shared. It is important to stay consistent with your                         messaging.                      ●  Personal branding connects you more with individuals. People connect better                         with other people than they do with companies. The more you work to build your                         brand, the more individuals you‘ll attract. They‘ll be attracted to your values,                         personality, and insights.                           The more individuals you attract, the more you‘ll build your overall business.                      ●  Personal branding allows you to become an influencer. An influencer is someone                         who significantly shapes the opinions of their followers and has a big influence on                         how they behave. There are some significant benefits to being an influencer.                           Big brands want to work with influencers, which can generate revenue for you.                         You often receive free things from companies who are interested in partnering                         with you. And you frequently get requests from the media to speak or just to                         attend events.                                                                    How To Build Your Personal Brand – Executive Summary  •5","Chapter 3:How to Build a Personal Brand                         ●  Step #1: Determine who you really are. Building your personal brand is about                         sharing your authentic self with the world.                           Ask yourself: What unique skills do I have? What are my core values? What am I                         most passionate about? What unique experiences have shaped who I am? How                         can I most effectively serve my core audience? What do I have to offer that no                         one else does?                      ●  Step #2: Determine what you want to accomplish. Once you‘ve identified the core                         of who you are, it‘s time to think about what you want to accomplish with your                         personal brand.                           Ask yourself: What would I like to accomplish, both personally and                         professionally? What do I want to be known for? If I could be the world‘s foremost                         expert on a topic, what would it be? What key message do I want to                         communicate? If I could only give one piece of advice, what would it be? What is                         the ”personality” of my brand?                      ●  Step #3: Identify your target audience. There is a core demographic of people                         who will resonate deeply with you, your brand, and what you offer. This core                         demographic is your target audience.                           To identify your core audience, ask these questions: Who can I most effectively                         help? Who will benefit most from my skill set and knowledge? Who am I most                                                             How To Build Your Personal Brand – Executive Summary  •6","passionate about serving? Who will resonate most with me and my brand?                           It can also be helpful to create a persona for your ideal client. This should include                         demographic information, desires and aspirations, as well as pain points and                         challenges that they face.                      ●  Step #4: Determine your Unique Service Proposition. Your USP is simply your                         brand summed up into a single, powerful compelling statement that describes                         exactly what you do for your audience.                           A USP typically looks something like this: I help (target person) to (achieve X) so                         that they can (outcome). Your USP doesn‘t have to say everything about your                         brand, but it should get right to the heart of who you are and how you help your                         audience. It may help to give your USP a unique name that will stick in people‘s                         mind.                           Don‘t skimp on this step. Creating your USP gives you a high degree of clarity                         about what your brand is all about.                      ●  Step #5: Start treating yourself as a brand. In every communication with your                         audience, whether a blog post, email, podcast, social media post, etc., you stay                         true to your brand message. You constantly speak about the problems you solve,                         constantly encourage your audience, constantly voice the message of your                         brand.                           It also means creating a strong, compelling website to serve as your home base                         for all your online activities. It means creating a media page or media kit on your                                                            How To Build Your Personal Brand – Executive Summary  •7","site for media inquiries. It could mean not answering emails yourself, but having                         an assistant answer them.                      ●  Step #6: Optimize your website. Your website functions as your”home base” of                         sorts. It is one of the primary places people get to know who you are and what                         you do. Your website also functions as one of the primary ways you turn visitors                         into paying clients.                           Optimizing your website includes: having a professional logo designed, showing                         off your USP, using professional photos, using testimonials, presenting a clear                         call-to-action, creating a compelling ”About” page, creating a services page,                         giving away free resources, creating a contact page.                      ●  Step #7: Develop your content strategy. The primary way you‘re going to build                         your brand is by creating strategic content, such as blog posts, videos, social                         media posts, emails, affirmations, and podcasts. Each piece of content you share                         with your audience should serve to build your brand.                           We recommend the ”Pillar Method” for your content. The Pillar Method involves                         creating longer pieces of content that function as pillars, of sorts. These pillars                         pieces are then cut up into smaller pieces of content that are shared across a                         variety of social media platforms. Using this method allows you to repurpose a                         single piece of content in a variety of ways.                      ●  Step #8: Constantly add value to your audience. It‘s essential that you constantly                         give value to your audience without asking for anything in return. The main thing                         people should take away when interacting with your brand is how much value                                                             How To Build Your Personal Brand – Executive Summary  •8","you provide.                           There will be times when you ask for a sale or ask someone to become a new                         client. The main emphasis, however, should be on adding value to your                         audience.                      ●  Step #9: Build a community. One of the best ways to build your brand is to build                         a community of people who can share ideas, support each other, and reach out                         to you directly. You create a tribe of passionate people who care about the same                         things you do.                           Some simple ways to build a community include starting a private Facebook                         group where people can encourage each other and share ideas, hosting live                         events where you can interact personally with your tribe, or creating a                         membership site where people can get exclusive access to you.
